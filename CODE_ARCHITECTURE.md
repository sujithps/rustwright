# Rustwright Code Architecture

Last updated: 2026-07-21

## Design Goals

- Preserve Playwright-compatible Python behavior at the boundary.
- Keep the Rust core responsible for direct CDP, process management, and
  high-throughput browser protocol work.
- **Keep every language shim as light as possible.** A shim owns marshalling,
  handle/memory ownership, and idiomatic naming — nothing else. Engine
  behavior (timing, deadlines, retries, actionability, wire encoding/decoding,
  option defaults, error taxonomy) lives once in `rustwright-core` and is
  exposed to all bindings; it is never re-implemented per language.
- Keep Python responsible for Playwright-shaped ergonomics, option validation,
  event/context manager behavior, and compatibility imports — but not for
  engine behavior (see the Shim Lightness Principle below).
- Add abstractions only when they reduce duplication or isolate real protocol
  complexity.
- Favor parity tests over speculative rewrites.

## Shim Lightness Principle

The single most expensive architecture failure mode in this repo is engine
logic accreting inside one language shim. It gets rewritten N times as other
bindings mature, and the copies drift. Both failure modes are no longer
hypothetical:

- The remote-CDP premature-timeout bug (#96) existed because the actionability
  deadline lived in Python while the per-probe cap lived in the core — two
  timeout engines disagreeing across the FFI boundary.
- The Node evaluate decoder silently drifted from the core serializer (it read
  `__rustwright_cdp_number__` and `pattern`/`flags` where the core emits
  `__rustwright_cdp_unserializable_value__` and `p`/`f`), so NaN/BigInt
  results leaked as raw wrapper objects and every RegExp decoded as `//`.
  Seven hand-written decoder copies existed across the bindings when this was
  caught.

The rule, applied to every change:

1. Anything expressible as a pure function of JSON-in/JSON-out — option
   normalization and defaulting, evaluate-wire encoding/decoding,
   timeout-precedence resolution, data-URL construction, structural result
   comparison — is implemented once in `rustwright-core` and exposed through
   the PyO3/napi/C-ABI surfaces.
2. Anything that owns a deadline, poll cadence, retry policy, or CDP
   round-trip sequencing lives in the core. A shim never contains a wait loop
   whose correctness depends on transport latency.
3. New engine-semantic surface (contexts, default timeouts, actionability
   states, trusted input) lands in the core first and is exposed to all
   bindings; a shim-only implementation of engine semantics is not accepted,
   even as a stopgap, unless explicitly gated as experimental for one binding
   with a core issue on file.
4. What legitimately stays in a shim: argument marshalling to the documented
   wire shapes, native-value coercion (e.g. JS `Boolean()`), handle lifetime /
   ownership, idiomatic naming, docstrings, and language-parity error-message
   formatting driven by structured payloads from the core.

`bindings/CONTRACT.md` carries the enforceable version of this rule for the
C-ABI bindings.

## Current Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib.rs` | `rustwright-core`: PyO3 extension, Chromium launch/connect, CDP client/session, browser/context/page primitives, protocol event handling, input/network/screenshot/PDF/tracing helpers. Compiled as the Python cdylib and as an rlib consumed by every other binding. |
| `python/rustwright/sync_api.py` | Main Playwright-compatible sync Python API: option normalization, public classes, locators, contexts, pages, requests, routes, assertions, event waiters, artifacts. |
| `python/rustwright/async_api.py` | Async Playwright-compatible facade over the sync implementation. |
| `python/rustwright/_devices.py` | Device descriptor data. |
| `python/rustwright/cli.py` | CLI entry points. |
| `python/rustwright/pytest_plugin.py` | Pytest fixtures. |
| `python/playwright/*`, `python/patchright/*`, `python/cloakbrowser/*` | Compatibility import packages. Public alpha compatibility imports should be enabled only through opt-in compatibility mode. |
| `rust-native/` | Native Rust facade crate over `rustwright-core` (crates.io `rustwright`); also the promoted engine facade the native-Rust MCP server builds on. |
| `mcp/` | `rustwright-mcp`: the shipping Python MCP stdio server (FastMCP) exposing `browser_*` tools. Runs standalone or in-process via `rustwright mcp`. |
| `node/` | napi-rs binding (in-process, links `rustwright-core` directly). |
| `capi/` | Shared C ABI (`librustwright_capi`) over `rustwright-core`; the boundary for the Go/Java/C#/Ruby/PHP bindings. |
| `go/`, `java/`, `csharp/`, `ruby/`, `php/` | C-ABI language bindings (alpha surface) + per-language conformance runners. |
| `bindings/` | Cross-binding contract (`CONTRACT.md`) and shared conformance case data. |
| `benchmarks/automation_cases.py` | 408 shared Playwright-style automation/parity cases and the 15-case benchmark subset, including WebVoyager/Mind2Web-style workflow cases. |
| `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py` | Rustwright and Playwright benchmark runner for the 15-case comparable workload. |
| `tests/test_rustwright_sync_api.py` | Main behavior/regression suite. |
| `tests/test_playwright_parity_cases.py` | Shared parity harness test entry point. |
| `tools/api_surface_audit.py` | Public API surface comparison against reference Playwright. |
| `tools/run_parity_cases.py` | Runs shared parity cases against Rustwright or reference Playwright. |
| `tools/run_antibot_benchmarks.py` | Anti-bot benchmark runner covering Tier 0 local smoke signals, Tier 1 public fingerprint adapters for SannySoft, CreepJS, BrowserScan, and DeviceAndBrowserInfo, and local Tier 4 fresh/warm profile matrix checks across Rustwright and Playwright. |

## Known Architecture Debt

The current implementation intentionally optimized for fast parity iteration.
The largest monoliths are now large enough to slow development:

| File | Current size | Debt |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `src/lib.rs` | 19,794 lines | CDP transport, browser state, event routing, DOM helpers, stealth/dedicated-worker identity wiring, network shaping, facade promotions, and PyO3 exports are all colocated. |
| `python/rustwright/sync_api.py` | 29,310 lines | Public API classes, option validators, event waiters, routing, locators, assertions, artifacts, and request helpers are colocated — and a large engine-in-shim share (see audit below). |
| `python/rustwright/async_api.py` | 6,447 lines | Hand-written async mirror of the sync API; ~242 of 404 methods are pure mechanical delegations that drift when the sync surface changes. |
| `benchmarks/automation_cases.py` | 16,158 lines | Shared parity cases and benchmark workflows are useful but increasingly hard to scan by subsystem. |
| `tests/test_rustwright_sync_api.py` | 29,011+ lines | Broad regression coverage is useful but hard to navigate by subsystem. |

This is acceptable for alpha while behavior is moving quickly, but the beta
bar should include splitting by stable ownership boundaries.

## Shim Weight Audit (2026-07-21)

Measured shim weight per binding (hand-maintained lines, excluding tests):

| Binding | Lines | Mechanism | Engine-in-shim findings |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Python | ~39,100 | PyO3 (in-process) | ~95% of all shim code; details below. |
| Go | ~850 | C ABI (purego) | Re-defaults `headless=true`; own wire decoder; own launch normalizer. |
| rust-native | ~820 | rlib (in-process) | Re-defaults `headless` + injects a 30s launch timeout; partial wire decoder. |
| C ABI (`capi/`) | ~540 | is the boundary | Passes launch JSON through raw, forcing every C-ABI binding to normalize. |
| Java / C# / Ruby / PHP | ~300–1,300 each | C ABI | Each: own launch/screenshot normalizer, own wire decoder, own harness helpers. |
| Node | ~420 | napi-rs (in-process) | Own launch/screenshot normalizer; wire decoder had drifted into a live bug. |

Python engine-in-shim inventory (`sync_api.py` unless noted):

- ~4,955 lines of the file are JavaScript inside Python strings; the
  actionability probe (`_target_state`) is rebuilt via string `.replace()` on
  every poll iteration.
- 34 `_try_fast_*` DOM fast-paths totalling ~2,027 lines — pure engine
  performance shortcuts, cleanly excisable as a unit.
- 31 `while True` poll loops; ~1,700 lines of deadline/poll/retry code
  (`_wait_for_single`, `_wait_for_fill_ready`, fill/select apply loops, 16
  near-identical page event-waiter loops, 21 event context-manager classes).
- The `expect()` assertion engine: ~1,000 lines of poll loop + probe JS.
- `APIRequestContext`: a hand-rolled urllib HTTP/proxy/redirect stack
  (~1,500 lines) parallel to the core's reqwest stack.
- Error classification by string-sniffing: the core maps every failure to
  `PyRuntimeError`, and Python re-derives timeout/crash/closed semantics by
  matching message substrings.
- The whole shim drives the core through ~104 native methods, most of which
  reduce to "evaluate this JS against a locator" — the core exposes few
  semantic DOM operations, which is the root cause of the accretion.

Cross-shim duplication (non-Python):

| Concern | Copies | ~LOC | Resolution |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Evaluate wire decoder | 7 | 820 | Decode once core-side; shims map leaf scalars only. |
| Launch normalize + defaults | 7 | 366 | Core accepts camelCase aliases; shim re-defaults deleted. |
| Screenshot normalize | 5 | 120 | Already parsed core-side (`capi`); delete shim copies. |
| Data-URL / JSON-equality / manifest validation (harness) | 5–6 each | ~1,700 | Move behind C-ABI helpers when harness work next opens. |
| Error mapping | 7 | thin | Already correct (core-owned strings) — the model to follow. |

## Shim Lightening Roadmap

Ordered tracks; each is independently landable and keeps parity tests green.

1. **Fix + centralize the evaluate wire decoder.** Repair the Node decoder
   drift against the core serializer (regression-tested), then add a
   canonical core-side decode so per-language decoders reduce to leaf-scalar
   mapping.
2. **Centralize launch-option normalization/defaulting.** serde camelCase
   aliases on `LaunchOptions`; delete shim-side re-defaults (Go, rust-native)
   and redundant key-mapping (Node).
3. **Generate the async Python facade.** Machine-generate the mechanical
   delegation methods in `async_api.py` from `sync_api.py` signatures with a
   checked-in-output freshness test; hand-written code shrinks to the ~160
   methods with real async semantics.
4. **Native actionability.** Land the in-flight native-actionability branch
   (Tokio-side waits, shared probe templates, trusted CDP mouse dispatch,
   structured `ActionTimeoutError`), reconciled with the #96 probe-budget
   semantics. Then extend to the sync path: native
   `wait_for_actionable`/`wait_for_fill_ready`/`click_actionable`/
   `fill_actionable` with an optional `on_poll` Python callback so
   locator-handler pages keep working, and structured timeout payloads so
   Python formats parity messages without string-sniffing. Trusted keyboard
   dispatch (`Input.dispatchKeyEvent`/`insertText`) is the missing input
   primitive.
5. **Move the 34 `_try_fast_*` DOM fast-paths into the core** as semantic
   native operations.
6. **Bundle the injected probe/action JavaScript core-side** (single injected
   script, no per-poll string assembly).
7. **Consolidate event waiters** behind one generic native waiter + a small
   Python descriptor table.
8. **Native `expect()` polling** returning `(passed, actual)`; Python keeps
   assertion API + message formatting.
9. **Structured error taxonomy across the boundary** (typed timeout/crash/
   closed payloads; retire substring classification).
10. **Core-side default-timeout register** (page/context), so
    contexts/default timeouts land once in the core instead of per shim.

Sequencing rule: tracks 1–3 are independent and safe now; track 4 gates 5–8
(they reuse its probe/loop machinery); 9 rides along with 4; 10 pairs with
the first binding that needs contexts.

## Target Rust Module Split

When the next behavior slices stabilize, split `src/lib.rs` into modules along
these boundaries:

| Target module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | PyO3 module registration and thin re-exports only. |
| `error.rs` | `RwError`, Python error mapping, timeout/error helpers. |
| `runtime.rs` | Tokio runtime construction and blocking Python boundary helpers. |
| `cdp/client.rs` | WebSocket transport, command IDs, session routing, send/receive loops. |
| `cdp/session.rs` | Target/session wrappers and CDP session lifecycle. |
| `browser/launch.rs` | Chromium executable resolution, launch args, env/proxy/default arg handling, process lifecycle. |
| `browser/mod.rs` | Browser state, context creation, close/disconnect behavior. |
| `context.rs` | Browser context state, permissions, emulation, proxy, storage hooks. |
| `page/mod.rs` | Page state, frame tree, lifecycle events, navigation. |
| `page/dom.rs` | DOM querying, selectors, element handles, screenshots/PDF helpers. |
| `network.rs` | Request/response shaping, routing, HAR-facing metadata, auth/proxy support. |
| `stealth.rs` | Default identity controls, webdriver suppression, user-agent/client-hint coherence, dedicated-worker identity wrappers, and anti-bot smoke helpers that belong in the Rust layer. |
| `input.rs` | Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen CDP dispatch. |
| `artifacts.rs` | Downloads, video, tracing, file output helpers. |
| `events.rs` | Internal event types and event dispatch helpers. |
| `serialization.rs` | JS value serialization/deserialization and handle previews. |

Split rule: move code only when tests are green before and after the move, and
avoid mixing behavior changes with mechanical module extraction.

## Target Python Module Split

Split `python/rustwright/sync_api.py` into modules once API behavior in the
target area has enough coverage:

| Target module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `sync_api.py` | Public imports/re-exports and compatibility class assembly. |
| `errors.py` | Public `Error`, `TimeoutError`, error message helpers. |
| `options.py` | Shared option normalization and Playwright-style validation. |
| `events.py` | Event emitter, waiters, context manager helpers. |
| `browser_type.py` | `BrowserType`, launch/connect validation and wiring. |
| `browser.py` | `Browser` lifecycle and context/page factories. |
| `context.py` | `BrowserContext`, storage, permissions, tracing/video/HAR hooks. |
| `page.py` | `Page`, navigation, waiters, dialog/download/file chooser events. |
| `frame.py` | `Frame` and `FrameLocator`. |
| `locator.py` | `Locator` and selector composition. |
| `element_handle.py` | `ElementHandle` and DOM handle actions. |
| `js_handle.py` | `JSHandle` evaluation and serialization helpers. |
| `network.py` | `Request`, `Response`, `Route`, WebSocket route objects. |
| `api_request.py` | `APIRequest`, `APIRequestContext`, API response objects. |
| `assertions.py` | `expect` implementation and assertion classes. |
| `artifacts.py` | `Download`, `FileChooser`, tracing/video artifact wrappers. |

Avoid circular imports by keeping low-level validators, event primitives, and
error types dependency-free. Higher-level modules may import lower-level
primitives, not the reverse.

## Testing Architecture

The test layout should move toward subsystem files without losing the current
full-suite safety net:

| Target test file | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_browser_type.py` | Launch/connect, option validation, browser engine support. |
| `tests/test_context.py` | Context creation, storage, permissions, proxy, emulation. |
| `tests/test_page.py` | Navigation, events, dialogs, downloads, file chooser. |
| `tests/test_locator.py` | Selectors, locators, actionability, assertions. |
| `tests/test_network.py` | Request/response, routing, HAR, proxy/auth. |
| `tests/test_artifacts.py` | Screenshots, PDF, tracing, video, downloads. |
| `tests/test_api_request.py` | API request context, cookies, redirect/retry/body behavior. |
| `tests/test_async_api.py` | Async wrapper parity and lifecycle. |
| `tests/test_api_surface.py` | API surface audit and import compatibility. |
| `tests/test_antibot_benchmarks.py` | Anti-bot benchmark target selection, text adapters, signal classification, and matrix aggregation. |

Until then, `tests/test_rustwright_sync_api.py` remains the canonical broad
regression suite.

Authoritative verification should run through the standard single-container
Docker path defined by `Dockerfile` and `tools/docker_verify.sh`. The script
keeps the container modes explicit: `pycompile` for the cheapest Docker check,
`focused` for a targeted pytest selector, `sampled` for focused iteration plus
a stratified nearby parity sample, `full` for full pytest and parity, `bench`
for the comparable benchmark matrix, and `antibot-smoke` for Tier 0/static
matrix anti-bot checks. Docker pytest modes load Rustwright's pytest plugin
explicitly and disable unrelated pytest plugin autoloading to reduce startup
cost for focused and sampled checks. The Dockerfile keeps tests/tools/docs
and README content outside the Rust package build layer and uses separate
Rustwright/Playwright browser caches so the reference install cannot prune
Rustwright's browser cache. Linux arm64 images use the Playwright arm64
Chromium as Rustwright's runtime browser because the Rustwright
Chrome-for-Testing installer is linux x86_64-only.

## Iteration Rules

- New behavior must have a focused pytest test and, when feasible, a shared
  Playwright/Rustwright parity case.
- For Playwright-compatible validation, sample real Playwright first and copy
  the first-line error shape.
- Do not add another large helper inside `src/lib.rs` or `sync_api.py` if it
  belongs to one of the target modules and can be introduced cleanly.
- Do not split files while a behavior slice is failing.
- Run slim focused tests during iteration, then shared parity, then the
  appropriate Docker verification mode before considering release-sensitive
  evidence authoritative.
- Keep public status and benchmark docs honest when test counts, benchmark
  numbers, supported functionality, or the compatibility contract change.

## Current Refactor Priority

1. Shim Lightening Roadmap tracks 1–3 (decoder fix/centralization, launch
   normalization, async generation) — independent, safe, in flight.
2. Land the native-actionability branch and extend it to the sync path
   (roadmap track 4); it unlocks tracks 5–8.
3. Extract Python option validators into `python/rustwright/options.py`.
4. Extract Python event waiters/context managers into
   `python/rustwright/events.py` (pairs with roadmap track 7).
5. Extract Rust launch/process code into `src/browser/launch.rs`, then CDP
   transport/session code into `src/cdp/`.
6. Split tests by subsystem after the corresponding code module split.

The module splits move code without changing ownership; the lightening
roadmap changes ownership (shim → core). When the two conflict, lightening
wins — there is no point splitting a Python file whose contents are scheduled
to move into the core.
